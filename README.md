# KLoc_MERN_Assignment
 
 Firstly, I thank Abhisarika Das, giving me choice to code any langauage.
 
The Challenge 

1. Create a simple web app that displays Food Recipes.
2. Users should be able to login and search for food recipes based on name or the ingredients used. 
3. Once the user selects one of the recipes, transition to a new page where you will display images, description, ingredients and the steps related to the Recipe.
4. Additionally a user should be able to sign up, Login and add/edit his/her own recipes.

My Approach:
Since I am a newbie to MERN stack, i decided to code my basic langauge HTML5,CSS and JavaScript.

1.Create a Front-end Home page and Other Pages.
2.Connecting to Api for food recipe Search and Get Recipe.
3.Connecting to Backend for login/register, creating own recipes.

Tasks Achieved.

1. Creating a simple web app that displays Food Recipes.
2. Search Food by Ingredients or name
   (try searching chicken or paneer)
3. On clicking get Recipes, he gets Summary of Recipe, further by clicking , he lands up a new page.

Task Un-Achieved.
1.Connecting to the Backend is not done.
2.Login/SignUp , Own recipes backend are not done.

Further Scope of the project:
1.Connecting to the backend using Firebase.
2.Creating own api.
3.Making Web app more responsive.
4.Developing a Good backend user base with authentication.

My Apologies.
1. Since i didn't have any hands-on experience on backend and Currenting working on my final year, Data Science project, I could not do the Backend part.

Outcomes:
1.Learnt to connect api.
2.Learnt to create a simple website.
3.Tried to connect backend through express.js, node.js and firebase , but cpuld not be able to implement.
